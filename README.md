# 04-Bootcamp-Homework
In this assignment I will be developing a timed codeing quiz. When the page is loaded there will be a prompt to start the quiz.
Once the quiz is started a timer will appear. If one of the multiple choice questions is answered incorrectly time will be subtracted from the timer.
Once the time has run out or all questions are answered a prompt will appear so that the high score and initials of the user can be logged.
